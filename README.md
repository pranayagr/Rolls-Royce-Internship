# Information Retrieval (Rolls-Royce-Internship)

I worked on the problem of optimizing information retrieval by application of knowledge graphs. 

I developed a pipeline for converting data in the text documents (NASA reports) into a knowledge graph 

Reading the data -> Recognition of concepts (NER) + Developing Relationships (Ontology) -> Structuring data -> Importing onto Graph Database -> Query using Cypher

Various components of the above pipeline are present above.
